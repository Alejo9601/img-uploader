You can see the demo of the project by clicking on the DEMO link that appears above in this file...

This is a challenge from DevChalleges (You´ll find link below). Particularly is about a web application that allows you to upload images to a remote server. It is a small project but in this case i wanted to separate as much as posible my folders structure always trying to get simple pieces of code to improve maintainability and also to practice some concepts. It was worthfit? you'll tell me :)

At first it seemed to be an easy coding challenge, but in the process I discovered that I didn't know how to handle files with my API, how to properly name files and functions (It's not my best ability). And like this last ones, many other doubts were appearing.

From my point of view I learned a lot, not just from the technologies used to build it, but from other questions like design, project structuring... in the future I'll love to get deeper into this last one.

I wish you cand use the demo and send me some feedback from it, check the code too... and feel free to propose anything you consider.
